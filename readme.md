Thinkful Street Fighter Project:

In this assignment, I was required to add code to app.js that will do the following:

- Cause Ryu to hop in his ready position when the cursor hovers over him.
- Cause Ryu to throw a Hadouken when he is clicked.
- Cause Ryu to switch to his "looking cool" pose when the user presses the "x" key. When the user releases "x", Ryu should go back to standing still.
